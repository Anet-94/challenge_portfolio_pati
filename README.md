# Task 1: Software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

Nowadays, IT is a very popular sphere, so nothing strange that I am interested QA as a first step in it. I am working for now, but my work is not interested for me anymore because I don't feel that I can develop myself there. Another and not less important reason is the salary which is Ukrainian and not enough for living abroad, so I decided that it's my chance for a new life. I hope it will be interesting for me but if not - I want to continue self-development in the IT, but maybe in Project Managment, where I should contact with people (It makes me a lot of pleasure).

Sorry for my open-hearted text, but every word is **truth**.
